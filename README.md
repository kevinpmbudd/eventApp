# event-app
This app makes it easy for users to spread the word about meetup events of all kinds they are planning. Gone
is just about every distraction and what remains are simple forms that allow users to post details about upcoming
events. The guest list can be stored, the date, time, all the relevant information but nothing more.

This project was generously generated with [yo angular generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular)
version 1.0.0.

## Build & development

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.
